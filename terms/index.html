These Terms and Conditions and the attached Application for Credit constitute the entire agreement between Buyer and Seller with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior and contemporaneous understandings and agreements, whether oral or written, between them with respect to thesubject matter hereof</p>

All past due amounts are subject to a service charge of 1.5% per month, retroactive to the date of the invoice, or up to the maximum rate permitted by law, whichever is less. Seller shall grant a lien waiver only to the extent payment is received, paid by the bank and not avoidable as a bankruptcy preference.Any invoice not in dispute shall be paid by the due date without offset, defense or counterclaim and regardless of controversiesrelating to other delivered and/or undelivered goods or any other contract between Buyer and Seller, except that Buyer may setoff or deduct from sums due Seller those sums owed by Seller to Buyer as agreed tobythe parties in writing or as finally determined by the final, non-appealable order of a court or other dispute resolution.

In the event Seller deems itself insecure, Seller may refuse delivery of the goods covered by any contract between Buyer and Seller except for cash, and until Buyer has paid for all goods previously delivered to Buyer, and Seller may stop delivery of all goods in transit. “Insecure” is intended to mean a good faith belief that the prospect of payment is impaired.</p>
